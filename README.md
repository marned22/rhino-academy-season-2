## This is the RhinoAcademy 2 Homeworks repository
This repository should contain all the homework assignments completed during the RhinoAcademy course.

## How to contribute

- Before starting with the homework assignment, please check the Class materials branch for any starter or helper files required for the homework assignment. You can find the Git repository here https://github.com/rhinoacademy/ra-learning-v2.

- When starting to work on a homework assignment please make sure you have created a new folder inside your repository with the name of the module you are working on. 
Module would be, git, html-css, javascript,etc.

- In the module folder there should be separate folders for each class. An example would be, git-intro, git-processes, html-css-intro , etc.

- Inside each class folder, you need to implement the homework assignment. The requirement of the folder structure and naming convention will be defined in each homework description.

Some examples of how the folder structure should be defined:
```
› root
    › html-css
        › html-css-intro
            › create-website
        › html-forms-css-layouts
            › login-register-form
            › order-form
        › css-layouts
            › exercise-1
            › exercise-2
```

- For each homework exercise ___we should be creating a new branch___ from the `main branch`. 
**Note:** Please make sure you have clean branches and not inherit the changes from other exercises/branches.

- Branch naming convention `<module-name>/<class-name-exercise-name>`, for example `html-css/html-forms-and-css-layouts-exercise-1`.

- Once you complete the exercise, please create a Pull request to merge the homework branch into the main branch. 

- For each assignment you should have a separate PR and assign the mentor that was leading the class and assigned you the homework.

## ENJOY CODING!
